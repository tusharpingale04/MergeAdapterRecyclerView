# Merge Adapter RecyclerView Sample

What is Merge Adapter?

MergeAdapter is a new class available in recyclerview which enables you to sequentially combine multiple adapters to be displayed in a single RecyclerView. This enables you to better encapsulate your adapters rather than having to combine many data sources into a single adapter, keeping them focused and re-usable.
